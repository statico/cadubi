.SH "NAME"
cadubi \- Creative ASCII Drawing Utility By Ian
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
cadubi is an application written in Perl that allows you to draw text\-based
images that are viewable on typical UNIX\-based consoles. Usually the
applications
that emulate these consoles support various text modes, such as background and
foreground colors, bold, and inverse. This text art, commonly called
"ASCII art", is used in various places such as online BBSes, email and
login prompts.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-h \-\-help
display some documentation
.TP
.BI \-m \-\-mute
turn off beeping
.TP
.BI "\-s ["W "] ["H ]
.TP
.BI "\-\-size ["W "] ["H ]
sets the size of the console for use with cadubi, where W is number of columns
and H is number of rows.
.TP
.B \-v \-\-version
show cadubi's version
.SH "CONFIGURING"
Beeping and command line options can be also set in /usr/bin/cadubi.
.SH "KEYBOARD"
.TP
.B i j k l
Move the cursor around. Holding down shift and typing these keys will move the
ursor five spaces instead of one.
.TP
.B space

.TP
.B return/enter
Move the cursor down one line and all the way to the left of the console.
.TP
.BI "delete " "or " "backspace " "or "`

.SH "USING"
Cadubi has a 'pen' which describes the current mode. Properties of the pen are
the painting character, foreground color, background color, bold, inverse, and
blink. Whenever you paint or use the text mode, the characters drawn on the
screen will have the properties of the pen. The current mode of the pen is
shown at the bottom of the console and is what will be drawn on screen
when you paint.
.
Typically, foreground text colors are the same as background colors, unless
the text is bold. If the text is bold, foreground colors are usually lighter
than
the background color, making text easier to read when the text has the same
foreground and background color. Refer to the Quick Help (control-'h') to see
what the colors look like on your console.

Text mode is an extremely useful feature. Once in the text mode you can type
as if you were using a normal text editor, and all the characters drawn
onscreen will use the same mode as the pen. To enter text mode,
press the 't' key. To exit, press escape.

When cadubi reads a file, it will only read as much that will fit in the
workspace (the area of the console minus the bottom row [status bar]). To gain
more workspace, see the '-s' operator in section "options".

Cadubi optimizes its output files to display properly and take up as little
space as possible. All cadubi output can be viewed with the 'cat' utility.

.SH "COLORS"
The color codes are case-insensitive.
The following color codes can be chosen as fore- or background colors:
.IP
0 or N \- Normal (standard text)
.IP
1 or W \- White
.IP
2 or R \- Red
.IP
3 or G \- Green
.IP
4 or Y \- Yellow
.IP
5 or B \- Blue
.IP
6 or M \- Magenta
.IP
7 or C \- Cyan
.IP
8 or K \- Black
.SH "WARNING"
Cadubi uses escape sequences for things like color. These may differ from
system to system. This means that the file generated by cadubi may
trash your console when viewed with for example cat.
It is generally safe to use the files on the
same type of console as they were generated on.
.SH "AUTHORS"
